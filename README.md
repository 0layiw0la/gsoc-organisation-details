# gsoc-organisation-details
A Python script to help with picking my GSoC organization. It scrapes all organizations, extracts their technologies, and saves them to a CSV file. It also allows filtering based on user input.

## How to use
**If you're familiar with Python, I'd advise using the [Jupyter Notebook](#) for more flexibility in filtering.**
